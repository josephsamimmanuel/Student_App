In this React.js and Tailwind CSS powered website, I've implemented a two-page navigation system using React Router. The first page showcases a list of students, leveraging the useContext hook to efficiently manage state across components. Users can easily mark students as favorites on this page. Navigating to the second page reveals a dedicated space for their favorite students, dynamically rendered based on the selected favorites using conditional rendering. The useContext ensures seamless data flow between components, enhancing the overall user experience.
Each student entry provides a convenient 'Add to Favorites' option, allowing users to curate their preferred student list. The second page, displaying the favorite student list, incorporates functionality to remove or unselect students, providing users with flexibility in managing their selections. Tailwind CSS is employed to ensure a clean and responsive design, enhancing the visual appeal of the website. This project showcases the powerful combination of React.js, Tailwind CSS, and thoughtful state management through useContext, creating an interactive and visually pleasing experience for users navigating through the student lists and their favorites.
